      closest thing to home, back when we lived in a village and not in a big city.
      And she was right! I almost forgot how much I missed the peace and quiet -
      and the fresh air too! "

    text: "But I remember we used to live in a really old big house, and there was
      a willow tree right outside my bedroom. I used to hang onto the vines and swing
      back and forth, until they\u2019d rip and I\u2019d fall off. Metal swing sets
      could never match how it felt. "
